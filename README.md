# CodingProblems

Solution codes written by c++ 17 for coding problems from collection sites such as Baekjoon Online Judge.

## Motivation

"To improve skills and sight of solving various problems" 

Programming is a logical process of solving problems in our world using computer as a tool.
As a programmer, problem solving ability is everything. 

* What kinds of problems can I solve?
* Can I solve problem the most efficiently following specific circumstance?
* How many various kinds of problems can I solve?
* Can I solve a unknown problem in the world?

Based on these critera, I intended to extend experiences bellow from solving world's well-known coding problems.

1. Understand and get used to old researches of algorithms and data structure deeply.
2. Improve time and space complexity of the solution (efficiency)
3. Try various problems as many as I can.
4. Think of other solutions that is not well-known.

## Features

* solutions of various problems
* comments of solving idea (working on)
* classified problems
* some non-standard custom algorithms
* some test codes available

## Tech/Framework Used

* c++ 17
* STL
